        <div class="hu" style="margin-bottom: 14px;" onmouseover="chg1()" onmouseout="chg2()"> 
            Folk music, is a type of traditional and generally rural music that originally was passed down through families and other small social groups. Typically, folk music, like folk literature, lives in oral tradition; it is learned through hearing rather than reading. It is functional in the sense that it is associated with other activities, and it is primarily rural in origin. The usefulness of the concept varies from culture to culture, but it is most convenient as a designation of a type of music of Europe and the Americas. <br> <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Indian_village_musicians.jpg/220px-Indian_village_musicians.jpg" alt="folk music instruments" style="float: right;width: 10cm;height: 8cm;padding: 1cm;"> Traditional village society had a vigorous musical life, in which many songs in most genres were known to, and often sung by, a large proportion of the population. Nevertheless, a degree of musical professionalism must have obtained; instrumentalists, though not formally educated, were specialists, as were singers of epic narratives (in the Balkans and Finland, for example) and singers of occupational songs such as sea shanties. Western cultures generally share the same genres of folk music. <br> <br> One of the most important is the ballad, generally a short narrative song with repeated lines. Epics are longer narratives in heroic style, which sometimes require many hours to sing. Some songs are ceremonial, meant to accompany events in the human life cycle or in the community’s year (such as those related to the agricultural seasons). Other common genres are work songs, love and other lyrical songs, songs to accompany games, lullabies, and children’s songs for enculturation (e.g., alphabet songs, proverbs, and riddles). These genres are usually differentiated through their texts, but some cultures also make musical distinctions. Instrumental folk music is most frequently an accompaniment to dance.

             <br> Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. Simon and Garfunkel met in elementary school in Queens, New York, in 1953, where they learned to harmonize together and began writing material. By 1957, under the name Tom & Jerry, the teenagers had their first minor success with "Hey Schoolgirl", a song imitating their idols, the Everly Brothers. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel. They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s, and their biggest hits—including "The Sound of Silence" (1965), "Mrs. Robinson" (1968), "The Boxer" (1969), and "Bridge over Troubled Water" (1970)—reached number one on singles charts worldwide. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO48MYmY?si=82f5785027a24c6f" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of their best work. <br> <br>

         <br> Robert Dylan, or Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American folk singer-songwriter, author and visual artist. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular and folk culture during a career spanning 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963) and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8f6VxHEcGCN?si=7687fc868b574f76" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of his best work. <br> <br>

      <br> Joan Chandos Baez, born January 9, 1941, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and activist. Her contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest and social justice. Baez has performed publicly for over 60 years, releasing over 30 albums. Fluent in Spanish and English, she has also recorded songs in at least six other languages.

      Baez is generally regarded as a folk singer, but her music has diversified since the counterculture era of the 1960s and encompasses genres such as folk rock, pop, country, and gospel music. She began her recording career in 1960 and achieved immediate success. Her first three albums, Joan Baez, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 and Joan Baez in Concert, all achieved gold record status. Although a songwriter herself, Baez generally interprets other composers' work, having recorded songs by the Allman Brothers Band, the Beatles, Jackson Browne, Leonard Cohen, Woody Guthrie, Violeta Parra, the Rolling Stones, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley, and many others. She was one of the first major artists to record the songs of Bob Dylan in the early 1960s; Baez was already an internationally celebrated artist and did much to popularize his early songwriting efforts. On her later albums she has found success interpreting the work of more recent songwriters, including Ryan Adams, Josh Ritter, Steve Earle, Natalie Merchant, and Joe Henry. Baez was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7, 2017. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0ylvIHUvZdj?si=b2cab2a80f624e84" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of her best work. <br> <br>

 <br> Nicholas Rodney Drake, or Nick Drake, was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has gradually achieved wider notice and recognition. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and a student at the University of Cambridge. He released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. He recorded two more albums—Bryter Layter (1970) and Pink Moon (1972). Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. There is no known video footage of the adult Drake; he was only ever captured in still photographs and in home footage from his childhood. <br> <br> Drake suffered from depression, particularly during the latter part of his life, a fact often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, Drake died from an overdose of amitriptyline, a prescribed antidepressant; he was 26 years old. Whether his death was an accident or suicide has not been resolved. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO33j7fa?si=591cf37e04584e8b" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of his best work. <br> <br>

 <br> Peter, Paul and Mary were an American folk group formed in New York City in 1961, during the American folk music revival phenomenon. The trio was composed of tenor Peter Yarrow, baritone Noel Paul Stookey and contralto Mary Travers. The group's repertoire included songs written by Yarrow and Stookey, early songs by Bob Dylan, as well as covers of other folk musicians. They were enormously successful in the early and mid 1960s, with their debut album topping the charts for weeks, and helped popularize the folk music revival. After the death of Travers in 2009, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo under their individual names. <br> <br> The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. Peter, Paul and Mary received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3S5p7z?si=c89eecab6f76426f" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of their best work. <br> <br>

 <br> Roberta Joan "Joni" Mitchell CC  (born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and painter. Drawing from folk, pop, rock, classical, and jazz, Mitchell's songs often reflect on social and philosophical ideals as well as her feelings about romance, womanhood, disillusionment and joy. She has received many accolades, including nine Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Rolling Stone called her "one of the greatest songwriters ever", and AllMusic has stated, "When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century".<br> <br> Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs ("Urge for Going", "Chelsea Morning", "Both Sides, Now", "The Circle Game") were covered by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, Song to a Seagull, in 1968. Her radio hits "Help Me" and "Free Man in Paris" and became her best-selling album. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX94esvuBEVw6?si=8a1f94de61064b07" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of their best work.  <br> <br>

 <br> Peter Seeger (May 3, 1919 – January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer and social activist.
 A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, Seeger also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of the Weavers, most notably their recording of Lead Belly's "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, counterculture, workers' rights, and environmental causes.<br> <br> A prolific songwriter, his best-known songs include "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" (with additional lyrics by Joe Hickerson),"We Shall Overcome"  "If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)" (with Lee Hays of the Weavers), "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" (also with Hays), and "Turn! Turn! Turn!", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement. "Flowers" was a hit recording for the Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963) while the Byrds had a number one hit with "Turn! Turn! Turn!" in 1965.<br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO11BQSH?si=23204ec1ffe54b73" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of their best work.  <br> <br>

 <br> Woodrow Wilson Guthrie  (July 14, 1912 – October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, and one of the most significant figures in American folk music. His work focused on themes of American socialism and anti-fascism. His music includes songs such as "This Land Is Your Land", written to oppose the American exceptionalist song "God Bless America", and has inspired several generations both politically and musically. <br> <br> Guthrie wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, Dust Bowl Ballads, was included on Mojo magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World, and many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Tom Paxton, Brian Fallon, and Sixto Rodríguez have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence on their work.
