             <br> Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (born March 10, 1994), known by his stage name Bad Bunny, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter. His music is often defined as Latin trap and reggaeton, but he has incorporated various other genres into his music, including rock, bachata, and soul. He is also known for his deep, slurred vocal style and his eclectic fashion sense. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny has frequently collaborated with artists such as J Balvin, Farruko, Residente, Arcángel, Jhay Cortez, and Daddy Yankee.<br> <br> In early 2020, he performed at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show as a guest, alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez,[3] and became the first Latin urban music artist on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. During the year, Bad Bunny released his second solo studio album, YHLQMDLG (Yo hago lo que me da la gana)—which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, the surprise compilation album Las que no iban a salir, and his third album, El Último Tour Del Mundo, which became the first all-Spanish-language album to top the US Billboard 200 and generated the Billboard Global 200 number-one single "Dakiti". He became the first non-English language act to be Spotify's most streamed artist of the year (2020). In 2021, Bad Bunny began making guest appearances in the professional wrestling promotion WWE, where he won the WWE 24/7 Championship once and competed in and won a tag team match at its flagship event, WrestleMania 37 for which he received praise. The same year, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list. <br><br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2apWzyECwyZ?si=0398994025db4bbb" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of their best work. <br> <br>

         <br> José Álvaro Osorio Balvín (born 7 May 1985), better known as J Balvin, is a Colombian singer and rapper. He has been referred to as the "Prince of Reggaeton" (from Spanish: "Príncipe del Reggaetón"), and is one of the best-selling Latin music artists with sales of more than 35 million records (albums and singles) worldwide. Balvin was born in Medellín, Colombia. At age 17, he moved to the United States to learn English, where he lived in both Oklahoma and New York. He then returned to Medellín and gained popularity performing at clubs in the city.<br> <br>Though his music is primarily reggaeton, Balvin has experimented with a variety of musical genres in his work, including electronica, house music, trap, and R&B. His original musical inspirations included rock groups such as Metallica and Nirvana, and reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee. He has collaborated with Latin American artists such as Ozuna, Nicky Jam, Alejandro Sanz, Bad Bunny and Pitbull. Despite working with many English-speaking artists such as Beyoncé, Pharrell Williams, The Black Eyed Peas, Cardi B, Dua Lipa and Major Lazer, Balvin continues to sing almost exclusively in Spanish, and hopes to introduce Spanish-language music to a global audience. He is also noted for his eclectic and colorful fashion sense. <br> <br> Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7HGyCQ2dcNx?si=c67e65bdca5a4ac7" target="_blank"> here </a> for some of his best work. <br> <br>
